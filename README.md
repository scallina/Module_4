# School District Analysis

## In this project, I assisted a chief data scientist responsible for preparing standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights about performance trends and patterns for a city school district. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. I assisted my client in analyzing data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. I was given access to student math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data and showcased trends in school performance using the included program.
